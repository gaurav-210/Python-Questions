# What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

 
# Name some of the features of Python.

*A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.

*Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritance.
Code can be grouped into modules and packages.

*The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.
Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised, so errors are caught sooner.

*Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.

*Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code.


# What is the purpose of PYTHONPATH environment variable?
It has a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code. PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.


# Is python a case sensitive language?
Yes, Like most of the widely used programming languages like Java, C, C++, etc, Python is also a case sensitive language.

Languages like Pascal, Basic, Fortran, SQL, Lisp, etc are case in-sensitive.



# What are the supported data types in Python?
Python has five standard data types −

Numbers
String
List
Tuple
Dictionary

# What is the output of print str if str = 'Hello World!'?
Hello World!

# What is the output of print str[0] if str = 'Hello World!'?
str ='Hello world!'
print(str[0])
output :- H

# What is the output of print str[2:5] if str = 'Hello World!'?
str ='Hello world!'
print(str[2:5])
output :- llo


# What is the output of print str[2:] if str = 'Hello World!'?
str ='Hello world!'
print(str[2:])
output :- llo world!

# What is the output of print str * 2 if str = 'Hello World!'?
str ='Hello world!'
print(str*2)
output :- Hello world!Hello world!

# What is the output of print str + "TEST" if str = 'Hello World!'?
str ='Hello world!'
print(str+"Test")
output :- Hello world!Test

# What is the output of print list if list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]?
It will print concatenated lists. Output would be [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ].

# What is the output of print list[0] if list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]?
It will print first element of the list. Output would be abcd.

# What is the output of print list[1:3] if list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]?
It will print elements starting from 2nd till 3rd. Output would be [786, 2.23].

# What is the output of print list[2:] if list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]?
It will print elements starting from 3rd element. Output would be [2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003].

# What is the output of print tinylist * 2 if tinylist = [123, 'john']?
It will print list two times. Output would be [123, 'john', 123, 'john'].


# What is the output of print list + tinylist * 2 if list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ] and tinylist = [123, 'john']?
It will print concatenated lists. Output would be ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.2, 123, 'john', 123, 'john'].

# What are tuples in Python?
A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.

# What is the difference between tuples and lists in Python?
The main differences between lists and tuples are − Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

# What is the output of print tuple if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )?
It will print complete tuple. Output would be ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003).

# What is the output of print tuple[0] if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )?
It will print first element of the tuple. Output would be abcd.

# What is the output of print tuple[1:3] if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )?
It will print elements starting from 2nd till 3rd. Output would be (786, 2.23).

# What is the output of print tuple[2:] if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )?
It will print elements starting from 3rd element. Output would be (2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003).

# What is the output of print tinytuple * 2 if tinytuple = (123, 'john')?
It will print tuple two times. Output would be (123, 'john', 123, 'john').

# What is the output of print tuple + tinytuple if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ) and tinytuple = (123, 'john')?
It will print concatenated tuples. Output would be ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003, 123, 'john').

# What are Python's dictionaries?
Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

# How will you create a dictionary in python?
Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([]).

# How will you get all the keys from the dictionary?
Using dictionary.keys() function, we can get all the keys from the dictionary object.
